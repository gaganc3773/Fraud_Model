# Fraud Detection Project

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent financial transactions using a deep learning model.

## **Overview**

- Built a binary classification model using a Deep Neural Network (DNN).
- Handled real-world challenges like class imbalance and large-scale data (~6M rows).
- Applied data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model fine-tuning.
- Evaluated using precision, recall, F1-score for effective fraud detection.

## **Tech Stack**

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

## **Dataset**

The dataset used is large (~470 MB) and not included in the repo. You can download it from [Google Drive](# Fraud Detection Project
